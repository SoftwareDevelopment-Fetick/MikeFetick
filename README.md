# MikeFetick â€” Great Software Development
This is a brief description of what you will find in this repository. 

Goal. The goal is to support the development of great software by presenting my continual work on:
 - Project Management of Information Systems,
 - Software Development.

Generally, this information is my work, organized into subfolders. The software code is my own work, unless otherwise credited with a reference to another author [many times]. All comments and suggestions are enthusiastically welcomed.

Software solutions can involve multiple software languages and technologies which can become complex and overwhelming. Code reuse is important, and the use of frameworks are encouraged. Also, code samples and cheat sheets are handy to have and are downloadable here.

Disclaimer. The scope of the information presented does not represent the complete, depth and breadth of information that is required for any discipline involved in software development. My attempt to organize the topics and work are to promulgate a cultural, business perspective in the areas of interests, namely integration, innovation, productivity, profit, security, and best practices.

Best Regards,

Michael Fetick
